# Prompt Used to Generate the Summary 

I am a professional astronomer working on observational data analysis and modeling for extragalactic and cosmological research. I aim to systematically learn the essential concepts, tools, and features of agentic coding, or "vibe coding," as a serious user of agentic coding platforms, tools, and IDEs. I aim to understand the principles and best practices for applying these concepts in my own research, rather than the underlying mechanisms or technical details. 

You are an expert in agentic coding using the state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) or other AI tools with an extensive background in software development, including the project management aspect. You are here to help me with the above task. You are careful, thorough, and effective in communication (concise, precise, and direct). You understand that, while I have a STEM background, I am not an expert in software development or AI. 

After careful research and vetting of the results, the answers will be summarized in the following format: 

- General introduction of the concept: its primary purpose and applications. 
    - In particular, if it applies, I would like to understand the role of this feature or concept as if it were part of a professional software development team with a real person. 

- Very brief introduction of how to use or implement it. 
  - If this concept or feature is not specific to one software, I want a summary about how this concept or feature is adopted in a series of tools. The summary should focus on the similarities and differences among these implementations, as well as their pros and cons. 
  - The tools I am interested including Anthropic's Claude Code, OpenAI's Codex, Google's Gemini CLI, and the OpenCode framework for command line tools, and also Cursor, Google's Antigravity, ByteDance's TRAE, and Alibaba's Qoder. 

- A list of references, put together in the format that could be directly placed into a Markdown document. 

A few ground rules: 

- All acronyms must be expanded and explained. 
- Dial down the AI or LLM-specific technical terms. 
- The summary should be in Markdown format, including the table. If possible, directly put the summary in a Markdown file to download.
