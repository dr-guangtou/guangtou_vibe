# Personal Notes from My Own Learning Experience

- Important to remember the "lost in the middle" effect. 
  - When design a prompt, keep the critical information in the beginning and the end. 

- Planning with Files
  - 3-File pattern: `task_plan` after each phase; `notes` during research; `deliverable` at completion.
  - `plan` structure: goal, phases, key questions, decision made, error encountered, and status.
  - `notes` structure: itemized sources and findings. 
  - Critical rules: 
    - 1. Always create plan first
    - 2. Read before decide
    - 3. Update after act
    - 4. Store, don't stuff: large output go to files, not context
    - 5. Log ALL errors
